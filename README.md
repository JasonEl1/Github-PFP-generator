# Github-PFP-generator
Randomly generates a default Github profile picture.

Default Github profile pictures are all 5x5 grids of pixels, displaying a random yet symmetrical pattern.
This program generates a random one, and can generate a new one at the click of the 'ENTER' button.

The program also saves the most recently generated profile picture as `output.png` in the Processing sketch folder.

Here's an example generated by the program:
